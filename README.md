#### Advent of Code solution presentation

This app is a Next.js single-page application in which I work through Advent of Code problems. No one here claims these are
by any means the best solutions, they are almost intentionally over-engineered and verbose, mainly trying to practice problem
solving with object-oriented programming, Node.js and Typescript, with vaguely mathy/rigorous plain language documentation/explanations.

###### Installation

(1) Clone repo
(2) `npm i`
(3) `npm run dev`
(4) Each problem page expects a .txt file with the problem input, but to respect Advent of Code's wishes
to not make individual inputs public, those inputs are not included in this repo. To run a solution's, page,
include the appropriate .txt file in the `inputs` directory. For example, for Advent of Code 2024 Day 1,
save your input for day 1 to `inputs/aoc2024/day01.txt`.

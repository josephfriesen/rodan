#### Advent of Code solution presentations

This app is a Next.js application in which I work through Advent of Code problems. No one here claims these are
by any means the best solutions, they are almost intentionally over-engineered and verbose, mainly trying to practice problem
solving with object-oriented programming, Node.js and Typescript, with vaguely mathy/rigorous plain language documentation/explanations.

###### Installation

(1) Clone repo

(2) `npm i`

(3) `npm run dev`

(4) This repo uses Prisma ORM with a sqlite db. To instantiate a database, run migrations and seed with a teeny tiny bit of data, run `npm run prisma:init`.
